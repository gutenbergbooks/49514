<h1>LITERATURE<br />
<span class="smaller">OF THE</span><br />
INDIAN LANGUAGES.</h1>

<p>A collection of all translations into the Indian languages is being made
in the Indian Bureau of the War Office.</p>

<p>The ensuing notices of elementary and other books, denote the progress
which has been made in this department of inquiry. The list is necessarily
incomplete, from the short time that has been devoted to the object.
It is issued in this form to apprise translators who have, or may enter this
field of labor, of the works received, that they may avoid sending duplicates;
at the same time, that they are requested to aid in completing the
plan by transmitting, under cover in all cases, to the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs, original or revised works, of every kind, including grammars
and vocabularies, which are not embraced in this incipient catalogue.</p>

<p>The true history of the Indian tribes and their international relations,
must rest, as a basis, upon the light obtained from their languages. To
group and classify them into families on philosophical principles, will be
to restore these ancient relations. Their traditions and historical affinities,
so far as they reach, will generally attest the truth of the facts denoted by
language. In our future policy, they should be removed or colonized in
reference to this relationship, and foreign groups not be co-mingled with
the cognate tribes.</p>

<p>The true object of investigating the languages, is thus perceived, and
it is hoped that its practical, and well as historical importance, will be appreciated
in ready responses from persons receiving these sheets.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">BOOKS AND TRANSLATIONS IN THE SEVERAL DIALECTS OF THE
<b>IROQUOIS</b>.</span></h2>

<p>The Iroquois tribes had acquired the highest reputation in war and diplomacy,
of all the Indian tribes of North America. At the time of the
discovery, they were in the ascendant, and were rapidly consolidating their
power under a system of confederacy, which had some striking traits resembling
our own. Their language, viewed in its several dialects, was not so
soft and flowing as that of their former rivals, the Algonquins or Adirondacks;
but impressed the listener by its masculine and sonorous tone. It
imparted a beauty to their geographical terminology, and helped to spread
the fame of their deeds over Europe.</p>

<p>Translations into this groupe of languages, were commenced at an early
period. A part of the Service of the English Church was executed under
the late Bishop Stewart of Canada, during the reign of Queen Anne.
Sixteen separate works, all of modern date, however, have been received,
of which, nine are in the Mohawk dialect, one in the Oneida, and six in
the Seneca. Nothing has been received or is known to exist in the
Onondaga, Cayuga, or Tuscarora. Ziesberger’s Dictionary of the Onondaga
in MSS., is known to be deposited in the library of the American
Philosophical Society, at Philadelphia.</p>

<h3>SECTION I.—MOHAWK.</h3>

<p class="first">No. 1.—<span class="smcap">Nene Karighyoston</span>, Tsinihorighhoten ne Saint John. The
Gospel according to St. John. New York: D. Fanshaw, for the American
Bible Society. 1 vol. 18mo. 116 pages. A. D. 1818.</p>

<p>In this early version, the Greek word “Logos,” and the Hebrew
“Yehovah,” are engrafted on the Mohawk dialect. The version is attributed
to Norton, a Mohawk Chief. The translation is accompanied
with the parallel English passages.</p>

<p class="first">2.—Ne Kaorihwadegenhti. The Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ according to St. Luke. New York: McElrath, Bangs &amp; Herbert,
for the Young Men’s Bible Society, Methodist Church. 1 vol. 109 pages,
12mo. A. D. 1833.</p>

<p>This translation is by A. Hill; corrected by J. A. Wilkes, Jr., Grand
River, C. W. This translation, like the preceding, contains the English
and Mohawk in parallel passages, and like that, is thus rendered a valuable
element in the study of language.</p>

<p class="first">3.—Ne Ne Jinihodiyeren. The Acts of the Apostles, in the Mohawk
language. New York: Howe &amp; Bates, for the Young Men’s (Methodist)
Auxiliary Bible Society. 1 vol. 12mo. 120 pages. A. D. 1835. Translated
by H. A. Hill, with corrections by William Hess and John A. Wilkes,
Jr. It is accompanied by a translation of the Epistle of Paul to the
Romans, in 56 pages, by the same translator and revisors.</p>

<p class="first">4.—The Gospel according to St. Mark. New York: McElrath &amp; Bangs,
for the New York District Bible Society. 1 vol. 239 pages, 12mo. A. D.
1829.</p>

<p>Of this translation, there exist earlier copies. It is from the pen of the
noted Chief, Captain Joseph Brant, called Tarenyawagon, by his people.
He employs the word Niyoh, for the Supreme Being. He gives the English
and Mohawk in opposite pages. The volume terminates with a collection
of sentences from the Scriptures, which are designed for practical
instruction. These are curious and valuable exemplifications of the power
of the two languages. In point of brevity and conciseness, the English
exceeds the Mohawk, as 25 to 38, (vide p. 192, et seq.) The mind of
that Chief would appear to have been well indoctrinated in leading Scriptural
truths, and exhibits no little power of appropriate selection in these
passages. If he became a savage in battle, and exhibited the peculiar subtlety,
cruelty, and power of Indian deception while on the war path, he
had the power to sink into a philosophic calm, in his study. This translation
is indeed, a better apology for the alleged cruelty of his life, than
the rather labored vindication in the volumes of his ardent biographer, the
late Colonel W. L. Stone.</p>

<p class="first">5.—The Epistle of Paul to the Galatians, in the Mohawk language.
New York: Howe &amp; Bates, for the Young Men’s Bible Society. 1 vol.
18 double pages, 12mo., with the Epistle to the Ephesians, 18 double
pages, 12mo. A. D. 1835. Translated by H. A. Hill, with corrections
by William Hess and J. A. Wilkes, Jr.</p>

<p class="first">6.—<span class="smcap">The Epistles of Paul</span>, in Mohawk, namely: To the Phillipians,
p. 17; To the Colossians, p. 16; To the Thessalonians, p. 22; To Timothy,
p. 31; To Titus, p. 11; To Philemon, p. 7. These six Epistles
of the Apostle, which are comprehended in 104 12mo. pages, are the translation
of William Hess, an educated Mohawk, with corrections by J. A.
Wilkes, jun. New York: Howe &amp; Bates, for the Young Men’s auxiliary
Bible Society, Method. Epis. Church, A. D. 1836.</p>

<p class="first">7.—Ne Yeriwanontonthæ ne ne Wesleyan Methodists. Lynn, Mass:
Newhall &amp; Hathorne. 12 p. 18mo. A. D. 1834.</p>

<p>This is a translation of the Catechism of the Wesleyan Methodists, published
at New York in 1836 by Waugh &amp; Mason, at the Conference Office,
200 Mulberry street.</p>

<p class="first">8.—Catechism of the Wesleyan Methodists, for children of tender years.
New York: Waugh &amp; Mason. 16 p. 18mo. A. D. 1836. Compiled
and published by order of the British Conference.</p>

<p class="first">9.—A collection of Hymns for the use of Native Christians, in the
Mohawk language. New York: D. Fanshaw. A. D. 1835. 147 p. 18mo.</p>

<h3>SECTION II.—ONEIDA.</h3>

<p class="first">10.—A Prayer Book, comprising the morning and evening service, and
other forms used in the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States.
New York: Swords, Stanford &amp; Co: D. Fanshaw, printer. A. D. 1837.
1 vol. 12mo. 168 pages.</p>

<p>This is a compilation made from several sources, by Rev. Solomon
Davis, missionary to the Oneidas, at Duck Creek, Wisconsin. It is not
without some inaccuracy that it is set forth as being in the language of the
Six Nations, nor can it be strictly asserted to be in the Oneida dialect,
although understood by that nation. The vocabularies that have been
taken denote very considerable differences in the languages of the several
Iroquois cantons, greater indeed, by far, than might have been expected,
when it is known that these tribes understand each other. The question
is one, rather of philology, than practical teaching, which we are informed
is sufficiently well advanced by the present work. It is here arranged under
the head of the Oneida dialect, from the known fact that Mr. Davis
labors, and has long labored with that people, and the observed prevalence
of the Oneida dialect, in portions of the work.</p>

<h3>SECTION III.—SENECA.</h3>

<p class="first">11.—Diahsawahgwah Gayadoshah—Reading lessons. Boston: Crocker
&amp; Brewster. 1 vol. 42 p. 8vo. A. D. 1836.</p>

<p>The clear and neat type and white paper of this little volume, and the
exact system of notation in which the Seneca tongue appears, denote the
careful labors, in this branch, of Rev. A. Wright, who has been for many
years a missionary of the American Board at the Buffalo Reservation, in
Western New York. There is a vocabulary of 16 pages, of concrete
terms and conversational forms, at its close, which adds to its practical
and philosophical value.</p>

<p class="first">12.—Ne Iaguhnigoagesgwathah—The mental Elevator. Nos. 11, 12,
13, 14. 8 pages each. Cattaraugus Reservation, Mission Press. A. D.
1846. 32 p.</p>

<p class="first">13.—The Mental Elevator, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14. 8 pages 8vo. each.</p>

<p>This miscellany, being the first and only thing of the kind, which has,
so far as is known, ever been attempted in a native tongue in America,
was commenced by the Rev. A. Wright, missionary of the A. B. C. F.
Missions among the Senecas of Western New York, at Buffalo Reservation,
Nov. 30th, 1841, and continued, after the removal of the Band to
Cattaraugus, in the same State, to the 31st December, 1846, which is the
last number received. It embraces in 112 closely-printed pages, an
amount of useful and instructive matter, which must be invaluable to those
of the Senecas who can read. Besides biblical reading, and pieces of
moral instruction, it embraces some matters relating to their government
and business, obituary notices, statistics, &amp;c. It appears from it that the
total population of all the Senecas of New York, in 1845, was 2,630; in
1846, 2,720, denoting an increase of births over deaths in one year of 90
souls.</p>

<p class="first">14.—The Gospel according to St. Luke, translated into the Seneca
tongue. By T. S. Harris. New York: Printed for the American Bible
Society, D. Fanshaw. A. D. 1829. 1 vol. 18mo. 149 pages.</p>

<p class="first">15.—Gaa nah shoh ne Deowaahsaonyohgwah Na wen ni yuh. Hymns
in the Seneca. Dosyowa, (Buffalo Creek,) Mission Press. 1 vol. 136
pages, 18mo. A. D. 1843. This translation is prefaced with Mr. Wright’s
system of writing the Seneca, and terminates with a descriptive index.</p>

<p class="first">16.—Sheet Ordinances, Seneca Chiefs, 4th December, 1847.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">BOOKS AND TRANSLATIONS IN THE VARIOUS DIALECTS OF THE
<b>ALGONQUIN</b>.</span></h2>

<p>Of all the groupes of the Indian language in America, the various dialects
of this stock have furnished the most inviting and best cultivated field
for the translator and philologist. The French, during their early and long
occupancy of the Canadas, gave great prominence to the various tribes
speaking dialects of this groupe. In proportion as the principles of the
languages have been investigated, the circle of the affinities of the Algonquins
has been found to be extended wider and wider. It is to be traced
from the ancient Powhatanic tribes of Virginia, northward and eastward
along the Atlantic coast to, and beyond the Gulf of St. Lawrence, reaching
to, and beyond the utmost limits of this stream at the source of the Mississippi,
and descending its eastern or left bank to the junction of the
Ohio, and thence to the Atlantic. From this great circle of occupation,
embracing the present area of sixteen of the States, the several branches of
the Iroquois, embracing the Wyandot and the Winnebago dialect of the
Dacota, are the only exceptions of modern date.</p>

<p>In the investigation of the dialects of this important groupe, fifty-five
printed works have been received, of which, twenty-eight are in the Odjibwa
or Chippewa dialect, ten in the Ottawa, seven in the Pottowattomie,
one in the Mohegan, one in the Montagnais, three in the Delaware, three
in the Shawanoe, and one in the Abenaki. More than three-fourths of
the whole number of the numerous tribes of this stock, are thus far, unrepresented
by translations of the Scriptures; a species of evidence of the
affinity of tribes which, as it is founded upon a fixed and accurately divided
standard, affords one of the best general means of comparison. It
is desirable, therefore, to collect all that has been, or may be done in this
branch of literature, not only respecting the Algonquin groupes, but also
in relation to each of the other groupes of our Aboriginal languages.</p>

<h3>SECTION I.—CHIPPEWA, OR ODJIBWA.</h3>

<p class="first">17.—The Gospel of John, in Chippewa. 1 vol. 12mo. 280 pages.
London: British and Foreign Bible Society, A. D. 1831.</p>

<p>In point of mechanical execution, and binding, this work is by far
the best volume of Indian translation, which has been sent among
the Sons of the Forest. It is the well-known translation of the
brothers John and Peter Jones, of the River Credit, Canada West,
which has been extensively used by our missionaries in the United
States, as well as the Canada Societies, and has the concurrence of various
denominations, as being a faithful version. It is a curious fact, that while
learned philologists are discussing the actual use, by the Indians, and existence
in the language, of the substantive verb, To Be, the native missionaries
should be in the constant use of various forms of the Chippewa
verb, I AU, alleged to be found among the Chippewas of Sault Ste. Marie,
in 1822, to denote, as is done in this volume, the various senses of “is,”
“was,” &amp;c. The orthography of this word as here given, as “Ahyah.”</p>

<p class="first">18.—The First Book of Genesis. 1 vol. 12mo. 178 pages. Toronto:
A. D. 1835.</p>

<p>This volume is printed by the Auxiliary Bible Society of Canada, at the
office of the Christian Guardian. J. H. Laurence, Printer. It is the work
of Rev. Peter Jones, the native missionary, and is deemed by missionaries
and teachers, who have devoted their attention to the language, an
authentic rendering of the entire fifty chapters of the original. There
is no attempt to exhibit a plan of orthography, or to employ the English
alphabet in a more fixed form than is known to common writers
and speakers. As the influence of the juxtaposition of consonants to
vowels, and their modifications from such contact, are well known, there is
little or no difficulty in arriving readily at the sounds intended by the translator
to be conveyed. The idiom of the Mississagie form of the Chippewa,
which is employed throughout this translation, is perceptibly different
from the more rigid and tense form of the vowel sounds, as heard in the region
of Lake Superior; but the language is literally the same, and well understood
by these northern bands. “Munedoo,” the term for God, instead
of Monedo, the northern form of it, and other analogous words, present
no difficulty to a northern ear or eye; for whatever indeed be the form of
orthography used, the native reader will retain the mother sound of the
word, and attach precisely such value to the syllables actually used in any
given translation, as shall bring out the entire and complete sound as known
to him from childhood.</p>

<p class="first">19.—<span class="smcap">The Gospel according to Matthew, in Chippewa.</span> 1 vol.
12mo. 112 p. Boston: Crocker &amp; Brewster, A. B. C. F. Missions, A. D. 1839.</p>

<p>This is substantially a re-publication of the Gospel of Matthew, which
originally appeared at York, now Toronto, Canada West, under the auspices
of the Canada Auxiliary Bible Society. It is understood to have been
the work of the brothers Jones. In this re-publication, the orthography
has been adjusted to the system prepared by the late Mr. Pickering, with
a few modifications, rendering it in all respects, conformable to the system
uniformly adopted in the publications of the American Board.</p>

<p class="first">20.—<span class="smcap">The Gospel of Luke, in Chippewa.</span> 1 vol. 12mo. Boston:
Crocker &amp; Brewster, for the Am. Bd. Com. for For. Missions, A. D. 1837.</p>

<p>This translation is the joint production of George Copway, a converted
and educated Chippewa, of the Mississagie tribe, of Canada West, and
Rev. Sherman Hall, of the Lapointe Mission, Lake Superior.</p>

<p class="first">21.—The Gospel of John, in Chippewa. 1 vol. 12mo. p. 83. Boston:
Crocker and Brewster. Printed for the A. B. C. F. M., A. D.
1838.</p>

<p>This is the version of John and Peter Jones, No. 22, adapted to the

<p>Here is a translation of Mr. Gallaudet’s popular “Definer,” with illustrations,
in the Chippewa, which exhibits the pictorial mode of teaching,
in a successful manner. The arts of design may certainly be employed, to
a great extent, in elementary teaching to the natives. There is no indication
of the translator’s name, or the field of his labors, which latter is
only known to be in the great missionary area of the Chippewas of the

p. 139. Boston: Crocker &amp; Brewster, A. B. C. F. M.</p>

<p>This volume has all the attraction of news and novelty for the natives, giving
information about people and countries, manners and customs, which
were before totally unknown to them. It is taken chiefly from the Peter
Parley series. The system of orthography is precisely that employed in No.
24, which varies, in some respects, from the system of the A. Board, and is to
be regarded as an attempt of the translator, whose name is not given, to amend
it. The forms of Chippewa substantives ending in <i>ngk</i>, are provided for
by a dash under the final vowels, thus <i>a̱</i> <i>e̱</i> <i>i̱</i> <i>o̱</i> <i>u̱</i>. As this <i>ngk</i>, or <i>ng</i>,
the g full, is both the participial form of the verb, and the ablative or prepositional
form of the noun, denoting, in the latter cases, on, in, or at,
agreeably to its antecedent, the abbreviation requires to be carefully noticed.
At page 88, at the foot of a wood cut giving the mode of travelling
on sleds drawn by dogs, in Siberia in the winter, if the vowel <i>i</i> in the
word “peb<i>o̱</i>in,” signifying winter, should not be put in its full prepositional
form in <i>ing</i>, or the vowel dashed according to the translator’s system,
the word Siberia should certainly have its local ending in <i>ng</i> or <i>ngk</i>; otherwise
the reading of Bemadiz <i>i̱</i> peb<i>o̱</i>in ima Siberia, is literally, In <i>travelling—winter—there</i>,
(or <i>that</i> place)—<i>Siberia</i>; and not, as the language permits—Travelling
in winter, there (or that place,) in Siberia.</p>

<p>Under the simple name of “Primer” this little work is one of much
value to the philologist, as well as being adapted to promote the advance
of the pupil. The Key to the spelling of the “Indian,” prefixed to it, is
more conformed to the ordinary standard of English orthœpy, than is practised
by the American Board, the vowels retaining, under limitations, their
natural <i>English</i> sound.</p>

<p>This appears to be a judicious compilation, and evinces much familiarity
with the modes of thought and expression used by the aborigines.
The introduction of the word “holy” in the Chippewa term of “Mah-no-tah-ho-ly-wun,
ke te zhe no ka zo win” (hallowed be thy name,)
is a peculiarity of the version of the Lord’s Prayer, here introduced,
and while the object is appreciated, the propriety of the mode of attaining
it may be doubted. There are some Ottawa idioms which would offer an
objection to the work in high northern latitudes. The names of the months
and <i>days</i> at page 120, must be deemed as quite local. It seems desirable
to make the record of this language as general and comprehensive as possible,
in all translations, and not to belittle its phraseology unnecessarily,
with localisms.</p>

<p>A compilation of Scripture, containing the sacred story of the Creation,
the death of Abel, the Deluge, the Ark, the building of Babel, the calling

<p>A considerable amount of Scripture knowledge is here put in the shape
of questions and answers, in 24 pages. This form is well adapted to the
instruction of the Indian mind, from the clearness and simplicity which it
may be made to assume. In the version of the Lord’s Prayer in this
school tract, the term “Gwatah-me-quan-dah-gwud,” is employed to express
“hallowed,” in its aboriginal form, and without the introduction of
“ho-ly,” to which we alluded in the notice of No. 31. This publication
is, however, three years older than the Chippewa Primer, the latter being
of the date of 1847, and the former, of 1844; and the suggestion, like that
of the use of the word “God,” in the version of the Bible by John Eliot,
may be considered as the result of more knowledge, or at least, <span class="smcap">BOLDNESS</span>

<p>This is a work of great labor and importance. It would have added
much to the interest with which it is regarded as a missionary triumph,
if some brief account had been prefixed to it, showing the various laborers

<p>This is one of the earliest translations made into our Indian languages,

while this tribe dwelt at Stockbridge, Mass., on the Housatonic River.
It has the following endorsement: “This translation was made by John
Quinney and Capt. Hendrick, who received his (their) commission from
General Washington. Little else has ever been translated into the Stockbridge
language besides this.” The name of the tribes is written on the

differs but little from the forms of words now used by the nations of this

<p>This is executed in the Meekerian system of notation. “The consonants

“Shawanoe,” may serve as an example of the two systems. It has not
perhaps, occurred to the author, that when the new system has been
learned by the pupils, there will be no other books to be read in it,
except those which he or others may publish, in accordance with this
very artificial and unpronounceable key; and that to the learner, the whole

<h2>CHAPTER III.—APPALACHIAN.</h2>

<p>This groupe is established, provisionally, on a geographical principle,
which considers in one family, all the tribes who formerly lived in the southern
latitudes of the Appalachian range. It has not escaped notice, that there may
be reasons for such a classification, on philological grounds. No one can
have given attention to the subject without perceiving marked resemblances
and affiliations, in the southern groupe of languages, such as exist between
the Choctaw and the Chickesaw, and with more remoteness between
the latter and the great Muscogee, or Creek family. Points of harmony in
the principles of utterance, exist between all these tribes, even where coincidences
in their vocabularies are reduced to but a few instances.</p>

<p>But it is clear that no classification, on philological principles, can be
successfully attempted until we possess comparatively full and reliable
vocabularies and grammars of all the tribes, cognate and diverse. When
such a classification is established, it is apprehended it must rest, as a
basis, on the Muscogee. The ancient confederacy of this type, had, in addition
to the Muscogees, or Muscogulges proper, the Hitchitees and
Coosadies. Events in their history, threw in the elements of the Utchees
and the Natchez, both diverse tribes, and who cannot now comprehend the
national language, without an interpreter.[A] The Apalaches, found by De
Soto, were, if judged by the names which the narrator of his expedition
employs, Muscogees. The Alabamas, who speak the Muscogee with some
peculiarities, appear to have been of the Coosada branch. The Seminoles
of modern days, are pure Creeks.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> The Appalachicolas are of the same
stock, without peculiarities. The Mobilians were pure Choctaw. The
only really anomalous elements in this wide-spread groupe, are the Natchez
and the Utchees, among the Creeks proper, and the Catawbas, with their
congeners, the Yamasees, of South Carolina. If the latter be not found to
have their analogies with the leading Muscogee stock, they occupied
country at an early day at least, in the southern seaboard portions of the
State, where some of the geographical names of the Muscogee language
are still found. Philological researches are probably destined to discover
in the Natchez and Utchees, membra disjecta of the <span class="smcap">Toltecan</span> groupe,
and thus to establish a historical link between the ancient Mexican and
American, or United States Indians.</p>

<p>Of the Cherokees, their fixed geographical position in the hills and alpine
valleys of the mountains; their compactness and permanency, their
peaceful policy with respect to the southern Indians generally, and their
language itself, appear to afford elements of a classification, of which the
original members, like those of the Iroquois, whom they resemble in their
original Totemic organization, the descent of the chieftaincy in the female

or south-west from the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The whole number of works received in the languages and dialects of
this mixed groupe, is forty-five; of which, twenty are in the Cherokee, and
printed in the Cherokee character; nineteen in the Choctaw; and four in
the Creek. Translations, vocabularies, and historical or illustrative information
respecting the Natchez, Utchees, and Catawbas, are of vital importance
to the establishment of this groupe.</p>

<span class="smaller">BOOKS, TRACTS AND TRANSLATIONS IN THE
<b>DACOTA</b>.</span></h2>

<p>But one member of this groupe had crossed the Mississippi, in their
ancient migrations, and fixed themselves in the area east of it. This tribe
was the Winnebagoes, who formerly maintained an independent position
in central Wisconsin. They went into Iowa, a few years since, and have
just completed their second removal into the country of the Chippewas,
on the west banks of the Upper Mississippi. There is thus left no portion
of this stock east of that stream, save, perhaps, a small band of the Sioux,
who are yet located on its east bank, between the Falls of St. Anthony and
the mouth of the St. Croix river. The great body of the Dacota groupe
extend westward (north of Iowa) to and beyond the Missouri, stretching
southwardly below the Rocky Mountains across the waters of the Platte.
The Iowas, the Otoes, Omahaws, Osages, &amp;c., are elder branches of this
groupe, who appear as a body, inclined to fall back, in that direction.</p>

<p>The principal missionary efforts have been among the Sioux proper, in
which there have been published, so far as known, thirteen separate translations;
at the same time there have been five translations in the Iowa, and a
single work, in each of the dialects of the Winnebago, Otoe, and Osage.</p>

<p>Of this work, 111 pages, 18mo., from page 9 to 100 inclusive, have
been received from Messrs. Irvin &amp; Hamilton, missionaries among the
Iowas, on the Missouri, in the service of the Board of Foreign Missions
of the Presbyterian Church of the United States. Its completion is looked

into Otoe. The sound of k following f, as in lra-ke-kofk, reminds the
observer of a common sound in the Tuscarora, which appears wanting in
all the dialects which are geographically located between them. It has
also, the final tl, a termination so common to the Aztecs.</p>

<p>The broad sound of the letter a, as heard in fall, is represented in this
compilation, by a peculiar enlargement of the letter. The word Wacondah,
the family name of this groupe, for the Great Spirit, is dropped, and
its place supplied by “Chihova,” (Jehovah.)</p>

to exist along the Oregon and California shores of the Pacific, by the

translation has been received. It was, it appears, the Sa-aptins, and not
the Flatheads of the Salish groupe, who applied for teachers, by performing
a long journey to St. Louis. And the small elementary work, below
noticed, is to be regarded as the first fruits of the mission established
among them.</p>

to be the only ones which are not known to the tribes east of the mountains,
but have their analogies in the Aztec family.</p>

<p>Mr. Hale, the ethnographer attached to Captain Wilkes’ Expedition,
observes of this tribe, that it is supposed to number 2,000 souls. The
Sa-aptins possess the country on the Lewis or Snake river, from the Petoos
to Wapticaciaes, about 400 miles. They resemble the Missouri Indians;
have horses, are good hunters, and make long excursions to the Rocky
Mountains. They had, formerly, wars with the Shoshonees, Crows, and
Blackfeet. They sent a deputation for missionaries, across the Rocky
Mountains. The disposition of this tribe has been much eulogized by
travellers. They are considered superior in intellect to the other Oregon
tribes.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
